Spotify Mood-Based Song Recommender
This project is a machine learning-based song recommendation system that recommends Spotify songs to users based on their real-time mood analysis. The application uses a combination of natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, and Spotify's API to analyze a user's mood and suggest songs accordingly.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to recommend songs to users based on their current emotional state. The recommender system detects the user's mood through real-time analysis of images (facial expressions) or text (emotions derived from input). After identifying the mood, it uses Spotify's API to fetch and recommend songs that match the detected emotional state.

Tech Stack
Programming Language: Python
Libraries/Frameworks:
Machine Learning & Deep Learning:
TensorFlow/Keras (for emotion recognition models)
OpenCV (for image processing)
transformers (for NLP-based mood analysis)
APIs:
Spotify Web API (for song recommendations)
Frontend:
Flask (to serve the web interface)
Data Handling:
Pandas (for data manipulation)
NumPy (for numerical operations)
Others:
spotipy (Spotify API wrapper for Python)
Scikit-learn (for mood classification)
Methodology
1. Mood Detection
We implemented two approaches for mood detection:

A. Image-based Mood Detection
Facial Emotion Recognition:
We used a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model trained on an emotion recognition dataset like FER2013 to detect emotions (happy, sad, neutral, angry, etc.) from facial images.
OpenCV is used to capture the user’s facial expressions from a webcam or uploaded image. The image is processed and passed through the pre-trained emotion detection model.
B. Text-based Mood Detection
NLP for Emotion Analysis:
The project also includes a natural language processing (NLP) component where a user can input text describing their mood.
For this, we used a pre-trained transformer-based model (such as BERT or DistilBERT) from the Hugging Face transformers library to perform emotion classification. The model identifies key emotions (joy, anger, sadness, etc.) based on textual input.
2. Song Recommendation
Once the user's mood is detected, the system leverages the Spotify Web API to recommend songs that match the emotional tone. The process works as follows:

Spotify API Authentication:
Using the spotipy library, we authenticate with the Spotify API to gain access to song data and user playlists.
Mapping Moods to Song Genres:
A pre-defined mapping is created between mood labels and music genres or playlists. For example:
Happy → Upbeat genres like Pop or EDM
Sad → Mellow or Acoustic genres
Neutral → Chill or Lo-fi playlists
Angry → Hard Rock or Rap
Fetch Songs:
Based on the detected mood, we search for relevant songs using the Spotify Search API and fetch song recommendations. The recommendations are filtered by genre, mood, and energy levels, providing users with tracks that best match their current emotional state.
Display Recommendations:
The recommended songs are presented to the user through a simple Flask web interface. Each song is displayed with its title, artist, and a play link to Spotify.
Installation and Setup
Prerequisites
Python 3.7+
A Spotify Developer Account (to create your own app and get credentials for the API)
Basic understanding of machine learning concepts
Steps to Install
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/spotify-mood-recommender.git
cd spotify-mood-recommender
Set Up a Virtual Environment:

bash
Copy code
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # For Linux/macOS
env\Scripts\activate     # For Windows
Install Required Packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Configure Spotify API Credentials:

Visit Spotify Developer Dashboard.
Create an app and obtain your client ID and client secret.
Add these credentials to a .env file in the root directory:
rust
Copy code
SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID='your_client_id'
SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET='your_client_secret'
SPOTIPY_REDIRECT_URI='http://localhost:8080/callback'
Run the Application:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:5000 to interact with the app.

Usage
The web app allows you to either:
Upload an image or use your webcam to detect your mood based on facial expressions.
Type a sentence describing your mood (e.g., "I feel happy today").
Based on the detected mood, the app will recommend a curated list of songs from Spotify that matches your emotional state.
Future Improvements
Improved Song Matching: Enhance the song-mood mapping by analyzing audio features like danceability, tempo, and energy directly from Spotify’s audio analysis API.
User History: Track user interaction with the app and their favorite songs to provide more personalized recommendations over time.
Mobile App: Expand the project into a mobile application for ease of use on smartphones.
Real-Time Mood Detection: Use real-time video streaming for continuous mood detection and dynamic playlist recommendations.
